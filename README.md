## Summary
There are more males than females who use the bike sharing service. The highest number of bike trips are requested during the working commuting times, suggesting that the service is largely used to commute to and from work, with the highest recorded day of bike request being between 5pm and 7pm on Thursdays. It would be worth exploring if there could be marketing incentives given during these times to encourage more people to commute to and from work by bike. In addition, sending incentives to customers to encourage them to become subscribers may yield more requests for bikes as we can see that there is a significant increase in use of services for subscribers than customers. I would also recommend exploring where the bike requests start on Thursday afternoons and early evenings to ensure the capacity of bikes meets the demand, and to also understand factors that influence the high demand to see if they can be replicated throughout the week to drive up sales and to compare if there is any crossover in Des Moines, IA.
